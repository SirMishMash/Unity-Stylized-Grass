## Required project settings  
In order to successfully implement SMM - Stylized Grass asset into your project, please make sure your project works with the High-Definition Render Pipline (2019.4.7+) or HDRP for short.

# Step 1: Getting Started

The following folders are organized in a way that will help streamline your understanding for both the asset and VFX Graph in Unity HDRP. <br>

Demo <br>
- A folder that contains files that help set up the scene "Demo - Grass" <br>

Prefabs <br>
- A folder that contains example prefabs that you can use and experiment with <br>

Textures <br>
- A folder that contains textures that affect how the grass is rendered and moves <br>

VFX Graph <br>
- A folder that contains VFX Graphs that affect how the grass is spawned <br>

Grass Profile <br>
- A diffusion profile used in HDRP that is used with the VFX Graphs provided to help create subsurface scattering effects
- Note: in order to successfully implement the profile, you must include the profile inside of the "Diffusion Profile List" in your HDRP settings.
